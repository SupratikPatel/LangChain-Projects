Agriculture is a major sector in India, accounting for around 17% of the country’s GDP and employing around 50% of the country’s workforce.\\n\\nElectricity is used in agriculture for a variety of purposes, including irrigation, pumping water, and operating machinery. The use of electricity in agriculture has increased significantly in recent years, as the country has seen a shift towards mechanized farming.\\n\\nAccording to data from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), India’s electricity consumption in agriculture was around 100 billion units in 2020-21. This represents around 6% of the country’s total electricity consumption.\\n\\nThe use of electricity in agriculture has several benefits. It can help to increase crop yields, reduce the need for manual labor, and improve the efficiency of farming operations. However, it also has some drawbacks, including the potential for environmental damage and the need for reliable and affordable electricity supply.\\n\\nTo address these challenges, the Indian government has implemented several policies and programs to promote the use of electricity in agriculture. These include the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) scheme, which aims to promote the use of solar power in agriculture, and the National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) program, which aims to create a unified market for agricultural produce.\\n\\nIn conclusion, India’s electricity consumption in agriculture is an important contributor to the country’s overall energy consumption. The use of electricity in agriculture has several benefits, but also some drawbacks. The Indian government has implemented several policies and programs to promote the use of electricity in agriculture and address the challenges associated with it.'"

The study was conducted using a cross-sectional survey methodology, which involved collecting data from 100 farmers in the state of Haryana, India. The results showed that the electricity consumption in agriculture had a significant negative impact on food security and economic growth. Specifically, the study found that the higher the electricity consumption in agriculture, the lower the agricultural productivity and the lower the income per head. Furthermore, the study also revealed that the electricity consumption in agriculture has a direct correlation with the level of poverty in the rural areas.\\n\\n## Keywords\\n\\nElectricity Consumption; Agricultural Productivity; Income Per Head; Poverty\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nElectricity consumption in agriculture plays an important role in the overall development of a country. It is essential for the production of crops, livestock, and other agricultural products. However, it can have both positive and negative impacts on food security and economic growth. This study aims to investigate the relationship between electricity consumption in agriculture and its impact on food security and economic growth in India.\\n\\n## Methodology\\n\\nThis study used a cross-sectional survey methodology, which involved collecting data from 100 farmers in the state of Haryana, India. The sample size was determined by random sampling techniques, ensuring that\""
